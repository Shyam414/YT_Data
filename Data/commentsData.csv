This is mainly because I lacked Python skills. However, as soon as I started the CS50 Python course, I realized there's a whole world of spatial analytics out there (which is essentially like supercharged spatial analysis with data science). I'm currently enrolled in CS50 Python and plan to take CS50 SQL next. After that, I wanted to know if Google's Advanced Data Analytics course is a good choice for someone like me who doesn't have a fundamental understanding of data science and statistics. I'm also interested in statistical learning, but I'm not sure how to go about it since it's currently in R on edX. I did find a book in Python for it, though.\n\nI also have an interest in computer vision applications in the field of earth observation and machine learning for spatial data patterns. Essentially, I want to do what Foursquare and CartoDB are doing in spatial data science, with a focus on image processing for earth observation (although this part can wait for about a year)."", 'Sir playlist suggest krdo , i find playlist and visuals more interesting', 'Actually these 3 books contains all the content.

This is the reality of employment for most people today.\n\nOverall, referral based hiring is a very humiliating and anxiety inducing process for those who don\'t have a large network. It also belittles merit and emphasizes a very wrong sense of trust. This type of socializing requirement these days from employment perspective forces someone to intentionally grow their network for benefits and doesn\'t feel natural unless you are one of those types such as attention seeker, party person or salesmaniac. The only other exception to these are if you come from a influential family where nepotism becomes a lifesaver or you are born a genius who can manipulate humanity through innovation and business like the tech billionaires of today.\n\nIf none of those things apply to someone then it literally compels them to be dependent on others to have a successful future and go forward in life no matter how hardworking or good of a person they are or else face the consequences of being left behind having to beg strangers to earn a living which they do either way regardless of referral before and during employment. It\'s not like you get any extra perks when hired through a referral,  you are still going to work with strangers who will be judgemental and you will still be subjected to attitude from co-workers and companies only care about making sure without taking any hiring efforts that you will be a complying robot who won\'t question anything.', ""It's very effective tip thanks for sharing!"", 'Thank you very much for your content.
