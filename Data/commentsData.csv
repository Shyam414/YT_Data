I'm currently enrolled in CS50 Python and plan to take CS50 SQL next. After that, I wanted to know if Google's Advanced Data Analytics course is a good choice for someone like me who doesn't have a fundamental understanding of data science and statistics. I'm also interested in statistical learning, but I'm not sure how to go about it since it's currently in R on edX. I did find a book in Python for it, though.\n\nI also have an interest in computer vision applications in the field of earth observation and machine learning for spatial data patterns.

This is the reality of employment for most people today.\n\nOverall, referral based hiring is a very humiliating and anxiety inducing process for those who don\'t have a large network. It also belittles merit and emphasizes a very wrong sense of trust. This type of socializing requirement these days from employment perspective forces someone to intentionally grow their network for benefits and doesn\'t feel natural unless you are one of those types such as attention seeker, party person or salesmaniac. The only other exception to these are if you come from a influential family where nepotism becomes a lifesaver or you are born a genius who can manipulate humanity through innovation and business like the tech billionaires of today.\n\nIf none of those things apply to someone then it literally compels them to be dependent on others to have a successful future and go forward in life no matter how hardworking or good of a person they are or else face the consequences of being left behind having to beg strangers to earn a living which they do either way regardless of referral before and during employment. It\'s not like you get any extra perks when hired through a referral,  you are still going to work with strangers who will be judgemental and you will still be subjected to attitude from co-workers and companies only care about making sure without taking any hiring efforts that you will be a complying robot who won\'t question anything.', ""It's very effective tip thanks for sharing!"", 'Thank you very much for your content.

qfpjblG31Mg,"['Uneducated, parents must be so proud', 'Eid al-Fitr is an Islamic festival that marks the end of Ramadan, the holy month of fasting when Muslims fast each day. It is the first time Muslims can eat during daylight hours after fasting during Ramadan. The translation of ‚ÄúEid al-Fitr‚Äù from Arabic sums up the holiday as it means ‚Äúfestival of breaking the fast.‚Äù\nEid al-Fitr is celebrated during the first three days of Shawwal, which is the tenth month in the Muslim (lunar) calendar. This means that the timing of Eid al-Fitr (and Ramadan) is different every year as it is based on the lunar cycle. It does not begin until the new moon is seen, which means it starts at different times for different Muslims around the world. However, some Muslims choose to celebrate Eid al-Fitr when the new moon first appears over Mecca instead of their own locations.\nMuslims around the world perform communal prayer at daybreak on the first day of Eid al-Fitr, after cleansing themselves and donning new clothes. They then continue to celebrate for three days. A common greeting during Eid al-Fitr is ‚ÄúEid Mubarak,‚Äù which means ‚ÄúBlessed Eid.‚Äù This greeting is used to wish other Muslims well during Eid. \nThese celebrations during Eid al-Fitr vary from country to country but include visiting family and friends, giving presents, enjoying feasts, wearing new clothes, and visiting the graves of relatives. Through these celebrations, Muslims show their gratitude to Allah after reflecting and fasting during Ramadan. \nThis holiday is also a reminder for Muslims to be grateful for what they have as well as to help the less fortunate. This is known as zakat, which is one of the five pillars of Islam. Zakat is a requirement that all Muslims with the means to do so donate to the less fortunate. Zakat significantly increases during Ramadan and continues as an important part of Eid al-Fitr.', 'TOU ALL NEED TO LEARN MORE ABOUT ISLAM MY BROSKIS.

Instead of direct cash distribution, the government uses its wealth to fund infrastructure projects, provide subsidies for electricity, water, and fuel, and offer its citizens various social services, including education and healthcare.\n\nThe government has undertaken economic diversification efforts, especially in Dubai, where tourism, trade, and services play significant roles in revenue generation. While there is no direct distribution of oil wealth, the government‚Äôs spending on public services and infrastructure indirectly benefits citizens, contributing to a high standard of living. Additionally, there are no personal income taxes in the UAE, which can be seen as another way citizens benefit from the country‚Äôs wealth.\n\nThe UAE‚Äôs approach is more about investing in the country‚Äôs future and providing a quality of life for its citizens rather than direct monetary handouts.
